# 🔍 Customer Churn Prediction – XGBoost Dashboard 

**Live Demo**: [Launch the Streamlit App](https://customerchurn-mxjnme2nlrphzcscndcm4h.streamlit.app/)

A secure, stakeholder-facing churn prediction system powered by XGBoost and Streamlit. This dashboard supports batch and single predictions, integrates MongoDB Atlas for user authentication, and includes a reproducible preprocessing pipeline. Designed for clarity, robustness, and business impact.

## 📘 Executive Summary

This project helps businesses identify customers at risk of churn using a machine learning model trained on Botswana banking data. It features:

- 🔐 Secure login via JWT and MongoDB
- 📊 Interactive dashboard for churn prediction
- 🧠 Reusable preprocessing pipeline and persisted model
- 🧪 Automated tests for reliability and reproducibility

Built for deployment on [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud), this app is modular, interpretable, and ready for stakeholder demos.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment (Windows PowerShell)**
   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment secrets**
   ```powershell
   copy .env.example .env
   ```
   Update `.env` with your MongoDB URI, target database name, and a strong `JWT_SECRET`. Ensure the MongoDB instance is reachable before launching the app.

4. **Train or retrain the model (optional)**
   ```powershell
   python scripts/train_model.py
   ```

5. **Run the dashboard**
   ```powershell
   python -m streamlit run app/app.py
   ```

6. **Run the automated tests**
   ```powershell
   pytest tests
   ```
